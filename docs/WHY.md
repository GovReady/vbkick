# Why ?

After vagrant 1.1 release, veewee stop working in a nice way (veewee conflicts with vagrant 1.1+, dependency issues and other blablabla) - there are of course some workaround available, but mixing installed vagrant package, gem, rvm, bundle in not pleasant in use:

 - https://github.com/jedi4ever/veewee/issues/611
 - https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant/blob/v1.2.0/CHANGELOG.md#110-march-14-2013

I have decided write something light, what do one thing well, a tool that I can rely on.

I think vbkick do now more than veewee did.
