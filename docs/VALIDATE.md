# Validate

Check already created virtual machine with defined features (Has a new VM Guest expected behaviour?).

Test should be smart enough to check what I really want to test, e.g. If I do not need chef, do not test whether I have chef.

Validate process is very similar to lazy postinstall method. Transport scripts via SCP and exec them using SSH command.

## adm_features.sh

Easy way to administer features/tests.
```
adm_context.txt         # list of scrips run by adm_features.sh (order matter), you can also use comments
adm_envrc               # list of env. variables (may be used by all scripts) - help keep important variables in one place, e.g. Virtualbox version
adm_features.sh         # take care about exec other scripts (features)
```

Use adm_features.sh is a convenient manner, but not mandatory.
