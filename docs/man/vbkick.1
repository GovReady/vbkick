       vbkick is easy in use and free bash script (with enabled  POSIX  mode).
       It  automate/simplify  Virtualbox Guest and Vagrant base box build pro-
       cess (only 1-2 actions are needed). New Virtual machine is describe  as
       a  code  in _d_e_f_i_n_i_t_i_o_n_._c_f_g (DEFINITION_FILE_NAME) file.  Task is mostly
       about running VBoxManage command in proper order with  proper  options.
       Uses also ssh and scp commands to complete the job.

       Kickstart  and  postinstall  files  are serve to VM via local webserver
       started in background.

       vbkick is supported by _c_o_n_v_e_r_t___2___s_c_a_n_c_o_d_e_._p_y  tool,  which  help  enter
       key-strokes into a VirtualBox guest programmatically from the host.

AACCTTIIOONNSS
       bbuuiilldd  Builds  a  new  Virtualbox  Guest from given _d_e_f_i_n_i_t_i_o_n_._c_f_g. The
              definition.cfg file must exist in  directory  where  command  is
              run.

       ppoossttiinnssttaallll
              Run defined postinstall scripts via SSH on the Virtualbox Guest.
              The _d_e_f_i_n_i_t_i_o_n_._c_f_g file is required in directory  where  command
              is run.

       vvaalliiddaattee
              Run  defined  features  scripts via SSH on the Virtualbox Guest.
              Check whether new VM Guest has expected behaviour.  The  _d_e_f_i_n_i_-
              _t_i_o_n_._c_f_g file is required in directory where command is run.

       eexxppoorrtt Exports  the  Virtualbox Guest as a Vagrant base box (base image
              for a future VMs) - _V_M___N_A_M_E_._b_o_x gzipped  file  is  created.  The
              _d_e_f_i_n_i_t_i_o_n_._c_f_g  file  is  required in directory where command is
              run.

       uuppddaattee Updates attached VBoxGuestAdditions iso and runs defined  update
              scripts via SSH on the Virtualbox Guest. The _d_e_f_i_n_i_t_i_o_n_._c_f_g file
              is required in directory where command is run.

       ddeessttrrooyy
              Remove the guest machine from Virtualbox. Doing this  will  also
              remove  the files containing the machineâ€™s virtual hard disks if
              they are not in use by another machine.

       sssshh    SSH to the guest machine with  same  ssh  options  like  postin-
              stall/validate/update.  The  _d_e_f_i_n_i_t_i_o_n_._c_f_g  file is required in
              directory where command is run.

       oonn     Turn on the guest machine.

       sshhuuttddoowwnn
              Turn off the guest machine using shutdown command  via  ssh.  If
              this fail then the acpipower button is used and if necessery the
              poweroff button. The _d_e_f_i_n_i_t_i_o_n_._c_f_g file is required  in  direc-
              tory where command is run.
