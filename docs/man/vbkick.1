       vbkick is easy in use and free bash script (with enabled  POSIX  mode).
       It  automate/simplify  Virtualbox Guest and Vagrant base box build pro-
       cess (only 1-2 actions are needed). New Virtual machine is describe  as
       a code in _d_e_f_i_n_i_t_i_o_n_._c_f_g file.  Task is mostly about running VBoxManage
       command in proper order with proper options. Uses also ssh and scp com-
       mands to complete the job.

       Kickstart  and  postinstall  files  are serve to VM via local webserver
       started in background.

       vbkick is supported by _c_o_n_v_e_r_t___2___s_c_a_n_c_o_d_e_._p_y  tool,  which  help  enter
       key-strokes into a VirtualBox guest programmatically from the host.

              Run defined features scripts via SSH on Virtualbox Guest.  Check
              whether new VM Guest has expected behaviour. _d_e_f_i_n_i_t_i_o_n_._c_f_g file

              Remove virtual machine from Virtualbox.  Doing  this  will  also
              remove  the files containing the machineâ€™s virtual hard disks if
              they are not in use by another machine.
